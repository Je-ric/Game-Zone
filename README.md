## ðŸ”§ Customization

You are welcome to explore, remix, and modify the code for your own learning or creative projects. Each game lives in its own folder and can be edited independently. Changes can be made directly to:
- `index.html` â€“ Markup and layout
- `style.css` â€“ Game appearance
- `script.js` â€“ Game logic and behavior

## ðŸš€ Running the Games

Simply open the `index.html` file inside any game folder in your browser. No installation or server required.

```bash
cd game-folder-name
start index.html
