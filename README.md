# Web Games Collection

This repository contains a collection of small browser-based games developed using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Each project is built without any external libraries or frameworks — just pure frontend code designed for learning, experimenting, and having fun.

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure and markup
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsiveness
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Game logic and interactivity

All games are self-contained and fully functional in modern web browsers, with no build tools or package managers required.

---

## Features

- No dependencies or frameworks
- Lightweight and mobile-friendly
- Modular and readable code
- Easy to modify and extend

---

## Customization

You are welcome to explore, remix, and modify the code for your own learning or creative projects. Each game lives in its own folder and can be edited independently. Changes can be made directly to:
- `index.html` – Markup and layout
- `style.css` – Game appearance
- `script.js` – Game logic and behavior

---

## Running the Games

Simply open the `index.html` file inside any game folder in your browser. No installation or server required.

Example:

```bash
cd game-folder-name
start index.html
```
